## <font color='red'> 5.1 Roles </font>
Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.

Galaxy is a hub for finding and sharing Ansible content.

Use Galaxy to jump-start your automation project with great content from the Ansible community. Galaxy provides pre-packaged units of work known to Ansible as Roles, and new in Galaxy 3.2, Collections.

Roles can be dropped into Ansible PlayBooks and immediately put to work. Youâ€™ll find roles for provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do everyday. The new Collection format provides a comprehensive package of automation that may include multiple playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.
