## <font color='red'> 5.1 Roles </font>
Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.

Roles can be dropped into Ansible PlayBooks and immediately put to work. Youâ€™ll find roles for provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do everyday. The new Collection format provides a comprehensive package of automation that may include multiple playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.

Galaxy is a hub for finding and sharing Ansible content.

Use Galaxy to jump-start your automation project with great content from the Ansible community. Galaxy provides pre-packaged units of work known to Ansible as Roles, and new in Galaxy 3.2, Collections.

In this Lab we're going to cover:

#### <font color='red'>Create a Role</font>
An Ansible role has a defined directory structure with eight main standard directories. You must include at least one of these directories in each role. You can omit any directories the role does not use.   

on the ansible controller:
```
cd ansible_projects/demo
mkdir roles
```
create a role:
```
ansible-galaxy init 
```
Note: By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content (also main.yaml and main):
lets take a look at the structure:
```
tree roles
```
